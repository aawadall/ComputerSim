# ComputerSim
an attempt to create a micro-computer simulator

## Brainstorming
I was thinking of defining the computer from the IC level as follows
* **ICs**: a set of integrated circuits, with predefined logic and pin assignments
* **Boards**: circuit boards, used to wire pins of ICs to consoles, one another and power sources
* **Consoles**: input/output devices, used by users to interact with this simulator
